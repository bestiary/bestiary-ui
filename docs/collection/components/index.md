# Components <Badge type="warning" text="In Development" />

Bestiary UI provides a set of high-level Vue 3 components designed for building professional administrative interfaces and dashboards.

## Current Status
We are currently finalizing the core component set. We focus on:
- **Accessibility (a11y)**: Ensuring components work for everyone.
- **Performance**: Minimal bundle size and optimized rendering.
- **Customization**: Flexible styling via CSS variables.

## Preview
The following components are already in the works:
- `BButton` & `BButtonGroup`
- `BBadge` & `BOverlayBadge`
- `BCard`
- `BSplitter`
- `BDivider`
