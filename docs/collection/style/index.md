# Style & Design Tokens <Badge type="warning" text="In Development" />

The `@bestiary-ui/style` package is the visual heart of our ecosystem. It contains the design tokens, atomic utilities, and semantic themes that power our interfaces.

## What's Inside?
Once stable, this module will provide documentation for:
- **Design Tokens**: Comprehensive color palettes, typography scales, and spacing systems.
- **Semantic Themes**: Out-of-the-box support for Light and Dark modes.
- **Utility Classes**: A full set of CSS utilities for rapid layout development (`b-flex`, `b-p-4`, etc.).

## Visual Language
We use the **Raven Design System** as our primary visual language. It is optimized for high-density information environments like admin panels and complex data tools.

*Documentation for atomic utility classes is coming soon.*
