# Utilities <Badge type="warning" text="In Development" />

`@bestiary-ui/utils` is a collection of essential TypeScript helpers and Vue-specific utilities used across the Bestiary ecosystem.

## Planned Features
- **Component Helpers**: Logic for global registration and plugin installation.
- **DOM Utilities**: Advanced focus management, event handling, and scrolling logic.
- **Shared Logic**: Common functions for prop validation and state management.

## Roadmap
We are currently extracting internal logic from our components into this shared package to ensure maximum consistency and maintainability.
